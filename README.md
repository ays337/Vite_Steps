## üöÄ Getting Started
### 1. Create Your Project Repo

- Start by creating a new repository using this template.

 > Only one team member should do this to avoid duplication.<br/>

- Set the **Owner** to your GitHub account.
- Choose a meaningful **Repository Name**.
- Make sure the repo is **Public**.

### 2. Clone the Repo

All team members should clone the newly created repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```
<br/>

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup

### 1. Open in VSCode

- Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
- Open a new **Integrated Terminal** (preferably Command Prompt on Windows).

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Make sure you're inside the `hackathon_struct` directory:

```bash
cd path\to\your\repo\hackathon_struct
```
### 3. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required packages, including Vite:
```bash
npm install
```
<br/>

## üß© Running the Project
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: The server.mjs must be running for the app to function correctly

> I would reccomend using two terminals, one for the app, one for the server.


### 1. Start the API Server

- Open a new terminal.
- Navigate to the `src` folder:

```bash
cd src
node server.mjs
```
### 2. Start the React App
- Open another new terminal.
- Navigate to the `hackathon_struct` folder:
```bash
cd ..
npm run dev
```
<img width="1626" height="415" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d05b4f6b-bc83-4b57-b2a8-ce9a407b9cd4" />

> One terminal for the app, one terminal for the server

### 3. Open the App
- Once both the server and app are running, open your browser and go to:
```bash
http://localhost:5173/
```

You should now see the starter template running.

## üìÅ Project Structure

This template provides a starter structure for a **Time Tracking Single Page Application (SPA)**. You can customize or remove parts as needed depending on your project goals.

### ‚úÖ Safe to Remove Files/Subfolders for a Fresh Slate
- `src/api/`
- `src/common/`
- `src/modules/`
- `src/store/slices/`
- `src/store/thunks/`

You may delete the **contents** of these folders, but it's recommended to to **keep the folder structure intact** for organizational purposes and to maintain compatibility with the existing file layout.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Recommended to Modify (Not Remove)

- `src/index.jsx`
- `store/index.jsx`
- `jsconfig.json`

These files contain core setup logic and path aliases that may be helpful to retain and adjust rather than delete entirely.

> üí° You can always refer back to this template repo if you're unsure about the structure or setup.

## üß† Tips & Notes
- ‚úÖ Always ensure you're in the correct directory before running commands.
  - The **React app** runs from the `hackathon_struct` directory.
  - The **API server** runs from the `src` directory.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è The server must be running for the app to function properly.

- üß≠ Use this template repo as a reference if you're unsure about the structure or setup.

- üõ†Ô∏è You can customize the file structure to fit your project, but the provided layout is optimized for quick development using Vite, React, Redux Toolkit, and Express.
